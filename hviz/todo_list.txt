Ideas for future work:

- Use a decaying weighting for cloud frames as an interpolation method.
  Investigate what kind of decay feels natural based on assumptions
  about the signal content of the scene.

- Investigate making stiffness a function of the probability. 
  E.g. if the object suddenly disappears, the force should fade out
  rather than having the constraint suddenly disappear when the 
  probability goes under the threshold.

High Priority:

- cloud interpolation


Medium Priority:
- Why haven't you hooked up two Kinects yet!

Low Priority:
- fix evaluateCloud so it takes arguments rather than relying completely on member variables.
- figure out why friction is still crunchy at very low amplitudes

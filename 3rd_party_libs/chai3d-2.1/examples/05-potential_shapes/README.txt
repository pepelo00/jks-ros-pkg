Platform: OS X / Xcode 3.2.1

Instructions:
Change scenes with 'n' key. In the third scene start the cat & mouse game with the main falcon button. 

Scene 3 Game Rules:
As long as the cursor touches the arena sphere or is within it, it is considered valid play. The sphere changes color depending no how far it is from the center of the arena. It will also quickly change colors when it is touching the arena to warn you that you are just about to go outside. Scene 3 is also zoomed in a little bit more, so it is possible to put the cursor outside the window (where you can't see it). There is also a top view in the top-right corner to help the gameplay.
